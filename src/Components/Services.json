        "Description": "Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public ledger called a blockchain. This decentralized ledger is maintained by a network of miners who use computational power to solve complex mathematical problems, a process known as proof-of-work. Once a problem is solved, a new block is added to the blockchain, and the miner is rewarded with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees."
